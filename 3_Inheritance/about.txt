Inheritance: It is a feature or a process in which, new classes are created from the existing classes.
The new class created is called “derived class” or “child class” and the existing class is known as the “base class” or “parent class”.
The derived class now is said to be inherited from the base class.

Inheritance are mainly 5 types 
1. Single:  A class that is derived from another class.
2. Multiple: A class can also be derived from more than one base class, using a comma-separated list.
3. Hierarchical: It is defined as the process of deriving more than one class from a base class.
4. Multi-level: A class can also be derived from one class, which is already derived from another class.
5. Hybrid: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance.

Modes of Inheritance in C++
Mode of inheritance controls the access level of the inherited members of the base class in the derived class.
In C++, there are 3 modes of inheritance:

Public Mode:  class ABC : public XYZ{...};//public derivation
Protected Mode:  class ABC : protected XYZ{...};//protected derivation
Private Mode:  class ABC : private XYZ{...};//private derivation

class ABC: XYZ{...}; //private derivation by default
