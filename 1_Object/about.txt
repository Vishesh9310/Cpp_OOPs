An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and functionality pertaining to that data.

if we need to use data member and member function of any class we need to create an object of the class.

example:
we have a class Car and it has data memeber mileage and speed and it has also some functin like On_headlight, Off_headlight,
and we need to use this members and function in a code:

Code in c++:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car{
    public:
    //data members
    int mileage=1000;
    int speed=120;

    //member functions
    void On_headlight(){
        cout<<"Head Lights are on"<<endl;
    }

    void Off_headlight(){
        cout<<"Head Lights are off"<<endl;
    }
};

int main(){
    Car new_car; //new_car is an object of the Class Car

    cout<<new_car.mileage;

    return 0;
}
