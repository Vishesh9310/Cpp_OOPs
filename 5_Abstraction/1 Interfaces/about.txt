//Interfaces:
    Interfaces play an important role in designing clean and well-organized code structures in C++.
    In C++, an interface is a conceptual construct that specifies a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that claims to conform to the Interface. It acts as a blueprint that enforces consistent behavior among its implementers while shielding the details of the actual implementation. By doing so, C++ interfaces enhance code modularity, maintainability, and reusability, aligning perfectly with the principles of object-oriented programming.

//Interface as a Concept:
    Although C++ lacks a defined interface keyword, the idea of an interface is accomplished through abstract classes and pure virtual functions. An abstract class has one or more pure virtual functions - functions specified in the base class but not implemented. These pure virtual functions serve as the methods of the Interface, setting up the requirements for any class that derives from the abstract base.

//Benefits of Interfaces:
1. Consistency and Contract.
2. Modularity and sepration of concerns.
3. Polymorphism and flexibility.
4. Extensibility and reusability.
5. Testing and mocking.
6. code documentation.

//Real-World Use Cases:
    C++ interfaces find applications in various real-world scenarios.
    Consider a GUI framework where different types of buttons (simple, toggle, radio) share a common behavior (e.g., click event).
    By defining an interface for button behaviors, the framework ensures that all button types implement the necessary methods, maintaining consistency across the board.

//Rules for using Interfaces:
1. Use Abstract classes.
2. prefix interfaces names.
3. no memebr data.
4. public access.
5. Explicit virtual and override.
6. implement all methods.
7. keep it focused.
8. Document interfaces.
