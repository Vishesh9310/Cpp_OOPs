Constructor: constructors are special functions of a class which are used to initialize the attributes of a class.
A constructor in C++ is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created
Constructors have the same name as the class and may be defined inside or outside the class definition.

There are 4 types of constructors in C++ classes:

1. Default Constructors: The constructor that takes no argument is called default constructor.
2. Parameterized Constructors: This type of constructor takes the arguments to initialize the data members.
3. Copy Constructors: Copy constructor creates the object from an already existing object by copying it.
4. Move Constructor: The move constructor also creates the object from an already existing object but by moving it.

Conclusion:
Constructors in C++ are special methods that initialize objects of a class.
They can be default (with no arguments), parameterized (with specific values), copy constructors (for deep copying), or move constructors (for resource transfer).
Understanding these types and their usage is essential for effective object initialization and management.

constructor is a special memeber function with the same name as of the class.
It is used to initialize the objects of its class.
It is automatically invoked whenever an object is created.

Characteristics of Constructors:

1. It should be declared in the public section of the class.
2. They are automatically invoked whenever the object is created.
3. They cannot return values and do not have return types.
4. It can have default arguments.
5. We cannot refer to their address.
