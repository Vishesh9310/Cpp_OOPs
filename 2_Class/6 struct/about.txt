In C++, classes and structs are blueprints that are used to create the instance of a class.
Structs are used for lightweight objects such as Rectangle, color, Point, etc.
Unlike class, structs in C++ are value type than reference type.
It is useful if you have data that is not intended to be modified after creation of struct.
C++ Structure is a collection of different data types.
It is similar to the class that holds different types of data.


//Structure
1. If access specifier is not declared explicitly, then by default access specifier will be public.
2. Syntax of Structure:
    struct structure_name{
        // body of the structure.
    }
3. The instance of the structure is known as "Structure variable".

//Class 
1. If access specifier is not declared explicitly, then by default access specifier will be private.
2. Syntax of Class:
    class class_name{
        // body of the class.
    }
3. The instance of the class is known as "Object of the class".
