//Data Binding:
    Data binding is the process of connecting a display element, such as a user interface control, with the information that populates it.
    This connection provides a path for the information to travel between the source and the destination.
    For example, consider the main window on your favorite browser.


// CPP Program to illustrate late binding 
#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 
    
class Base 
{ 
public: 
    virtual void show() { cout<<" In Base \n"; } 
}; 
    
class Derived: public Base 
{ 
public: 
    void show() { cout<<"In Derived \n"; } 
}; 
    
int main(void) 
{ 
    Base *bp = new Derived; 
    bp->show();  // RUN-TIME POLYMORPHISM 
    return 0; 
}
